 VDOP was specified by following line: VMIC=20 MAX=180                                                                 
 VDOP is depth-dependent
 VDOP depends on element, since VMIC was specified: VDOP^2 = vmic^2 + vtherm^2
 Criterion that defined VDOP for wavelength resolution:
 Minimum from all Doppler line widths, element = G

 VDOP was specified by following line: VMIC=20 MAX=180                                                                 
 VDOP is depth-dependent
 VDOP depends on element, since VMIC was specified: VDOP^2 = vmic^2 + vtherm^2
 Criterion that defined VDOP for wavelength resolution:
 Minimum from all Doppler line widths, element = G

 VDOP was specified by following line: VMIC=20 MAX=180                                                                 
 VDOP is depth-dependent
 VDOP depends on element, since VMIC was specified: VDOP^2 = vmic^2 + vtherm^2
 Criterion that defined VDOP for wavelength resolution:
 Minimum from all Doppler line widths, element = G

 VDOP was specified by following line: VMIC=20 MAX=180                                                                 
 VDOP is depth-dependent
 VDOP depends on element, since VMIC was specified: VDOP^2 = vmic^2 + vtherm^2
 Criterion that defined VDOP for wavelength resolution:
 Minimum from all Doppler line widths, element = G
